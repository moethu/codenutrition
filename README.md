**Imagine your code and all dependencies would carry nutrition labels.**

Code Nutrition Facts is a service for labelling code so everybody can understand what they are getting into when building upon or using your software. The survey is based on a set of questions presented by Felix von Leitner: "NÃ¼tzlich-Unbedenklich Spektrum" at 36C3 (Minor adjustmenst have been made to the original text.)

The survey itself is still under development you are welcome to discuss, contribute and improve it. Currently it consists of 9 fundamental questions regarding the state of your (legacy) code. After answering them by multiple choice the service generates an embeddable badge representing the state of your project. I highly reccommend completing the survey even if you don't want to use the badge - the questions asked can be very helpful.

Again, the intention of this repo and the survey is to get the conversation started and potentially develop a solid metric representing the state of a project.
